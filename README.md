# Project Description
Identify any correlation of certain residential home traits on House Pricing within USA States using a real estate data set. 

# Analysis
Research 3 main questions: 
1. Q1: What impact do the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, acreage and house size have on House Sale Prices?   What has the strongest correlation?
2. Q2: How do the above correlations vary by State?
3. Q3: What is the average pricing for a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom home by State? 	

# Steps
1. Clean realtor_data.csv data and save clean_states.csv Script: 'data_cleaning.ipynb'
Remove null, outliers. Keep States used in study: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York
2. Q1 and Q2 Analysis and Visualization script 'sanbox.ipynb'
3. Q3 Analysis and Visualization script '

# Badges
? On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

# Visuals 
PASTE SCREEN SHOTS HERE from Q1, Q2 and Q3 plots here. 
? Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

# Installation
? Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

# Support
? Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

# Roadmap
Frequency of releases / updates to this project by initial team: Never.

# Contributing
?State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

# License
open source / no licensure required

# Project status
?If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
